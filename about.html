            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>We strive to be a good, trustworthy scource to purchase supplies for incoming architecture students who are un sure of what kind of supples they need and how much money they can save in the process. All of us are students who are familiar with the feeling of uncertainty when it comes to building models. No one should be limited in their practice just because they're worried about material costs. That's why we're happy to provide a curated site with trustworthy material manufacturers so you can work comfortably work instead of wasting energy stressing about pricy materials.</p>
